This is our project where we are predicting Boston House price. The dataset is freely available on sklearn library.We did EDA on it. Finally we plotted a regression line on this dataset after training it. Later we have deployed it on Heroku.
The steps were:
heroku login,
git init,
heroku create file_name,
git add,
git commit -am "initial commit",
git push heroku master
